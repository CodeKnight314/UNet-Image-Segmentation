# UNet Semantic Image Segmentation for Aerial Imagery of Dubai

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of UNet for Semantic Segmentation of Aerial Images, classifying land, water, buildings, roads, and vegetation. The code includes training and inference scripts to generate semantic maps of input images. This repository is built for educational purposes on the implementation of UNet and its application in real-world scenarios.
